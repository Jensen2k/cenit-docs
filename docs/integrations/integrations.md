# Integrations

The Integrations Menu facilitates the organization of all the resources inside a tenant. By creating a Collection you can group together all the elements related to a specific integration andÂ  it could be subsequently converted to a Shared Collection in order to make it accessible from other tenants. When Collections or Shared Collections are available, you are able to start from there, so you can take advantages of the existing integrations and gain productivity.

In the Integrations menu, you can select [Collections](integrations/collections.md) or [Shared Collections](integrations/shared_collections.md).
