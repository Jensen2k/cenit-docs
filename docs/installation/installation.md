# Installation

One of the best features of Cenit IO is the capability of running in the cloud as well as on-premise. The choice is up to the user.

### Running Cenit IO in the Cloud

For running Cenit IO in the cloud you just need to access https://app.cenit.io

### Running Cenit IO on-premise

- [Docker Composer](installation/docker_composer.md). This is the best way of intalling Cenit IO on-premise. However it's temporarily unavailable, so you need to use an alternative until Docker-Composer works again. 

- [Alternative to Docker Composer](installation/alternative.md). This guide shows the installation of Cenit IO step by step.
