# Users.

Only administrators can add new users.

Go to the Users Menu at Administration and press the + sign in the generic task bar:

![Adding a user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99367633/160734537-ddeeef39-f088-481c-89da-82e980277844.png)

The system then presents a view to fill in the appropriate items:

You can edit a user from the list, as shown in the figure bellow:

Another way to add a new user, is assign it in a tenant.

![New user in tenant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99367633/160736533-9b2719e7-375f-4806-80fc-36d712617a04.png)

Administrator can delete a user from the tenant view or in the list of users.

A tenant would have several users according to the customer needs. In this case, all the users of a tenant must be added by an administrator.

Simple users can only access to the tenants they belongs to.

Simple users can add new tenants to isolate the elements that he or she wants, but tenants added by simple users can only be accesed by themselves or by administrators.
