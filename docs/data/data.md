# Data

Cenit has been designed to solve unique integration needs and orchestrate data flows that may involve different data formats. It makes possible to exchange data as well as  JSON, XML and EDI documents between different endpoints and third party services on the cloud or permissive applications. In order to implement an integration, you need to  define some Data Types in Cenit to describe all the information managed by the different flows.

The Data Menu allows you to define the structure of objects(records) as a  [Document Type](data/document_types.md). 

Besides, you can define [File Types](data/file_types.md) which are important when dealing with files, such as images, pdf, etc .
