# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Cenit IO in less than 30 minutes**.

**Cenit IO** is a 100% open source integration Platform (iPaaS) that is modern, powerful, yet hackable to the core, ready to use in the cloud [Cenit IO-Integration Platform as a Service](https://app.cenit.io) or on-premises. It has been designed to solve unique integration needs, orchestrates data flows that may involve different types of authentication methods, protocols, and data formats. All of these features enable Cenit to support a wide range of integration use cases. It is particularly valuable to embrace a pervasive integration approach.
