# Recipes

A Connector App is a special kind of [collection](integrations/collections.md) which provides all the resources (authorization, connection, webhooks, data types, events and algorithms) to handle the import and the export process of a set of records. By using one or more connector apps you can gain productivity by reducing time and effort when you create an integration. The process is even easier if you use the [Connector Factory](connector_factory/connector_factory.md) to create a Recipe after [creating one or two connector apps](connector_factory/creating_a_new_connector_app.md)

A Recipe is a special kind of collection which provides all the resources to implement the mapping process between two connector apps. It can be generated in an easy way by using the Connector Factory. You just need to specify you want to map a Data Type A in the Connector App A to the Data Type B in the Connector App A or B, together with a few settings and your mapping process will be ready to be used.

## Accessing the Recipes View inside the Connector Factory

In the Connector Factory interface, press the button for switching between the Connectors and the Recipes view, then select Recipe, as shown below.

Once inside the Recipe view, you can create a new recipe as well as managing the existing ones. The picture below shows the Recipe view.
